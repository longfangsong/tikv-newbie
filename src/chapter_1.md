# Perface

Today I decided to write a guide for a newbie to understand [tikv](https://github.com/tikv/tikv)'s code.

Yes, I know there're already a series of source code analyzing [here](https://pingcap.com/blog-cn/#TiKV-%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90) and [here](https://tikv.org/deep-dive/), these are awesome learning resources. This book won't replace these. But I think since these articles are written by experienced tikv contributors, it might be affected by the [Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge). As for me, there're many things I want to know which are not covered in these articals.

So I'll try to write this book **during** I read the source code. I wish this book can be a good learning resouce for those who wish to contribute or learn the source code of tikv.

But since I'm new in tikv I cannot promise there're no mistakes in this book, so please read the book **with** the source code and other resources. And feel free to communicate with the author if you found any problems.
